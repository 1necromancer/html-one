            <h3>Small description:</h3>
            <p>The phrase "water lily tetrahedral" most likely refers to the plant species Nymphaea tetragona, also known as the pygmy water lily or small white water lily. <br>The term "tetrahedral" in this context likely refers to the plant's overall shape or possibly the shape of its flower parts, though it's not a formal botanical term. It's a small, perennial aquatic plant with floating leaves and white flowers. </p>
